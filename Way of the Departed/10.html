        <b><i>I take a good look at Nom as I make my way to the city hall.</i></b> Sounds of hammering echo though the streets. Dozen of carpenters are working on mending the buildings. The towers and their metal ornaments gleam in the setting sunlight, but knowing what I know now, I get an eerie feeling like nails are being hammered into a coffin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jerahn, Seliel and her father are waiting for me as I step into the city hall. The atmosphere is tense, but the Mayor still insists on certain formalities, greeting me warmly and thanks me again for the help during the Nindroid crisis Jerahn shifts uncomfortably and impatiently. Seliel is stone faced. It is not clear how much he has told her father, but he certainly knows something. He is trying hard not to look at my scar (rift) which does not feel natural.
        </br>
        I end up telling him everything except exactly how I got all of this information. Seliel is concerned about 'rogue magic' and to mention a conversation with a ghost on a painting would not help. I do everything I can to incriminate Jerahn as little as possible, and as I talk them through it, he seems relieved. The Mayor does not. I am trying hard to read his reactions. How much of this is new to him and what does he actually know? I try to be as diplomatic as possible, but it is obvious that he takes some of it as an accusation. Also it seems he has not been completely oblivious to the fact that the Edo era villages were abandoned under suspicious circumstances. But he lets me finish before he erupts.
        </br>
        <i>
          'WHAT IS THIS!?! DO I LOOK LIKE A CROOK!?! I am the MAYOR of this fine town. I have RESPONSIBILITIES! The BOARD OF COMMERCE expect this town to become a CITY! TO PROSPER and GROW! Our dealings with Borg Industries are not enough! We DO NOT need and image of INDUSTRY! We need CHARM… a DISTINCT PROFILE… AUTHENTICITY… We need TOURISM!'
        </i> He breathes hard as he finishes his tirade. Then he deflates. He feels like man who has been under too much stress for too long, and has been led to do things he has not been completely confident with. Seliel and Jerahn look surprised as he changes from anger to fatigue.
        </br>
        <i>
          'I should have never trusted that man. Why did I trust such a strange man?'
        </i>
         he mutters to himself.
         </br>
         <i>'What man father?'</i> Seliel asks.
         </br>
         The Mayor sighs deeply. <i>'He came by here 5 months ago. I have not seen him before or since. He had claims on these old plots of land with abandoned decaying villages on them. He spoke highly of their houses' value, their historic significance and their precious rare metal ornamentation. He wanted to make sure the they would not wither and be lost to time. He gave me the claims and a map for nothing. I only had to promise I would honour his wishes and preserve the buildings. He was going to leave for a while. I had to ask him several times if I had understood his proposal right. He seemed sincere but he spoke in a very strange and broken accent. When I asked he was going he said Metalonia.'</i>
         </br>
         I feel like I am being hit by my own hammer again.
         </br>
         <i>'What… what did he look like?'</i> I ask. But I already know the answer to that.
         </br>
         <i>'Strange. He looked strange… He had these big metal hands, a beard and wore a heavy helmet. A big man.'</i>
         </br>
         Seliel can tell that I am shaken. I can feel it. I was expecting that it was Clouse who had somehow found a way to fool the Mayor. But Karloff?!?! He is our friend now. Last time I saw him, Jay and I had just freed him and the blacksmiths from Krux and Acronix's swamp facility. Jay complained for days about being sore from his big iron grip hug. Why would he have turned. Why would he be involved in this?
         </br>
         I tell them about Karloff. The Mayor has been duped and I have no reservation to trust him now. He needs my help. This whole town does. Suddenly the Mayor panics.
         </br>
         <i>'I need to stop this… I need to…'</i> He bolts past me out of the city hall. Seconds after there is turmoil in the street. We follow. The Mayor is screaming at the carpenters to stop their work. People are peeking out of their houses and start gathering in the street. Several noble looking men, the board of commerce I assume, march at the Mayor. The carpenters start to climb down from the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><i>From the edge of town,</i></b> the Skullkin lookout swallows hard. Or whatever makes it up for swallowing hard in a Skullkin. The new King will not like this. No one notices the rattling of bones as it departs and makes its way into the forest where a grotesque skull-like vehicle on huge wheels awaits. As it reaches maximum speed, a blinding purple flash ejects it from Ninjago for its travel to the realm known as the Underworld.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><i>Things are heating up inside the city hall.</i></b> The board of commerce demands to know what is going on and why the Mayor has halted the construction. Apparently some distinguished delegates and potential investors will arrive in Nom is a few short days. They want the buildings to be completed so the town will look its best. Seliel signals me and Jerahn and we slip away. I feel bad for the Mayor. I have never understood politics and even the governments of Ninjago are unclear to me. Seliel is still pretty intense, but now her focus is directed at the bigger picture.
        </br>
        She looks up at the Edo towers where the last bit of sunlight has given away to darkness and the rising moon. She sighs. We fill her in on EVERYTHING… details of the dreams, Master Yang's painting, Jerahn's past, Karloff and Clouse. If Clouse is behind this, he has at least one big advantage: When Wu fought his ghost on the Dark Island and he escaped through the vortex, we have no idea where he escaped to. And he has obviously had both the time and resources to plan this out. We have no idea what we are up against. The missing Edo-villagers worries me. We have seen Clouse use dark magic to turn people against each other before. Is this what has happened to Karloff? It's a dreadful thought, but I kind of hope so. The thought that he would turn against us by his own free will is worse.
