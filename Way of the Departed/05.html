        <b><i>The next morning Seliel asks me if I slept well.</i></b> I lie and say that I did. She gives me a short tour of the town. It has changed a lot since we were last here. Ornate buildings have been built in the style and tradition of the Edo period. It reminds me a lot of the Temple of Airjitzu and the whole village has a lot more charm to it now. It all seems very authentic. When I ask about it Seliel tells me that some of it actually is authentic. It was brought here and restored from some decaying villages several hundred of miles south.
      </br>
      I wonder what Patty Keys would make of this. Probably better keep it a secret, or that poor old mail man will have yet another nail in his coffin. We really should talk to Cyrus Borg and get him to develop something to help him out.
    </br>
    We arrive at a dojo. Seliel proudly presents it as the Phantom Dojo. I guess I don't respond the right way, because she suddenly blushes and start talking about how silly that name is and how she means to change it. Her great inspiration is Nya, how she kept her identity secret and the rumours of a Samurai X cave. I tell her about the new Samurai X, and how no one knows who it is. Big mistake! She is all over me with questions I cannot answer, so I derail the barrage of questions asking to see the inside of the dojo.
      </p>

        <b><i>Cole seems distracted.</i></b> I feel foolish about trying to impress him with that stupid name of my dojo, but I think there is something on his mind. And I am also just stalling. That glowing scar on his face. He has been avoiding my questions about it, but it's obvious that it's not natural. That's why want him to meet Jerahn. He is my aide and my sparring partner. He is younger than me, but he seems to have an older soul. He is a bit of an enigma to me but I trust him. He arrived here six months ago. He didn't talk much and seemed bewildered, confused, and aimless. Like someone whose life has just been uprooted and needs to find a new direction. We are a welcoming community, my father insists on it, so we took him in and offered him a home and food in exchange for work. He renovates buildings for us. He turned out to be more helpful than we could have imagined.
      </br>
      Here he is now! He pauses as he enters the room and stares at Cole like he has seen a ghost. His eyes are filled with wonder. No… not wonder. I can't quite read his expression. It's not confusion either. There is a bit of surprise somewhere in there. A moment passes. I look over at Cole. There is no particular reaction from him except he smiles politely. Jerahn walks across the room looking long and intensely at Cole's scar. Then shifts his eyes to meet Cole's.
    </br>
    <i>"You look different!"</i> The greeting catches Cole off guard.
    </br>
    <i>"Have we met before? Do I know you?"</i> Cole replies.
    </br>
    <i>"We've met before. But we have never been properly introduced. When we last met you punched me in the face."</i> Cole looks completely lost now.
    </br>
    <i>"You didn't know my name then. You called me Chuck."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><i>I feel like I am being hit by my own hammer.</i></b> Hard! I don't recognize the guy, but I recall the situation.
        </br>
        It is the Night of the Departed. I am being held in these special chains that work on ghosts. I need to stop Yang and am doing my best to reason with my guard. When that fails I change my approach and “persuade” him in a different way. I have thought about the situation many times since. I say the first thing that pops into my mind. It's not exactly clever.
        </br>
        <i>"I didn't know you had long hair… and sorry… for punching you… and calling you names too, I guess."</i>
        </br>
        His face lights up in a smile. <i>"Are you kidding?!? You freed me… us. Look at me! I am whole again. You can call me Chuck all day long if you want to. I owe you!"</i>
        </br>
        I breathe a sigh of relief, but still don't know what to say. After an awkward moment Seliel cuts in. I am grateful for that.
      </br>
      <i>"This is Jerahn. He is our best carpenter. Or at least our most agile. If you need a roof mended Jerahn is your guy. He really knows how to swing a hammer and he knows AIRJITZU!"</i>
      </br>
      Smiling Jerahn looks at the hammer hanging behind my back. <i>"I guess that makes two of us."</i>
      </br>
      My head is flooding over with questions. So Yang was right! There was a person here who may be able to help. But how was Yang able to reach out to this place? Why did Seliel want us to meet and how did she know that we had a connection? Before I can ask, Seliel asks about my scar again. She looks strict now. When I try to evade the question, she cuts me off. She wants to know exactly what it is. Jerahn shifts uncomfortably. My mind is racing. Do I come clean? What should I say? I hardly know anything and this is way too personal. We stand there and the tension is unbearable.
      </br>
      Seliel shifts her eyes to Jerahn like she is giving him an unspoken command. Jerahn brushes his pale brown hair away from his face. And there is it is! It has the same shape and placement as mine. But it is not glowing green. It looks more like a real scar. Is it a scar?
      </br>
      <i>"It appeared on me a few days after,"</i> he says. <i>"The others got 'em too. They aren't always there though. They appear and disappear. It doesn't hurt when they are there. Only when they come and go. It varies how long they are there too."</i> I take my eyes off his scar, and look him straight in the eyes. <i>"Have you had… dreams?"</i>
      </br>
      He does not like that question. He looks over at Seliel with fear and guilt in his eyes. He hasn't told her.
      </br>
      <i>"I…  I need to go. I've got some… roofing to do."</i> He stutters and paces out of the dojo.
      </br>
      Seliel does NOT look happy. <i>"I do not appreciate having secrets about strange stigmatas, rogue magic, and communal dreams roaming around in MY town! We are not finished!"</i> She shoots me a scornful look and walks off after Jerahn.
      </br>
      I feel pretty bad about myself.
      </br>
      Outside the sun shines warmly. I would enjoy it if didn't feel so guilty. I spot Seliel walking fast between two houses in search of Jerahn. I want to apologize and come clean to her so I start to follow her, but she weaves in and out of narrow alleys and it's not easy to keep up.
      </br>
      Suddenly an arm grabs me and pulls into a doorway. My scar illuminates the darkness in an eerie green glow.
      </br>
      It's Jerahn. He hushes me as he leans out and looks up and down the street.
      </br>
      <i>"There is something else I need to show you!" </i>
