        <b><i>I will soon be dreaming the dream again.</i></b> I am sleeping, but my awake thoughts keep popping in. It is not exactly easy falling asleep knowing what I know now. I have to sleep with a blindfold tonight. The light from the rift illuminates the room too much. Also, my dream has changed. I have an external view of myself this time, like I am a floating spirit watching. I cannot move and just watch as Morro breaks through the ice and cleaves my head. My headless body drops to the ground and the rift hangs in mid air convulsing. Morro doesn't seem surprised. This was the expected outcome for him. He stares deep into the Departed Realm, then slowly raises his arm and reaches in. In a bright green flash he is violently pushed back. Inside the Rift the faces float by in the twisting maelstrom of green. Morro's voice has a hollow pained feel as he snaps angrily at them.
      </br>
      <i>"Why do you fight it? Why are you so complacent? You could be free like I am! Just pass through and hook on to something! Be free! What's so good about where you are now?"</i>
    </br>
    There is something truly desperate about Morro's voice. It dawns on me, that he is not really angry that the ones in the Departed Realm won't accept him. He advances on the rift again…
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><i>The Skullkin crashes through the wall.</i></b> The clacking of bone echoes through the Underworld and the other Skullkin cower as bones scatter across the blackened floor. The sickly green ghostly glow from the Edo sorcerer who has risen from his throne mixes with the blue vapors emitting from his clenched hands.
        <br>
        <i>"WORK IN NOM HAS STOPPED?!? WHY?!? SPEAK!"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The awkward silence that followed seemed to last forever. The Skullkin skull found it immensely hard to speak having been separated 20 feet from its lower jaw. It wasn't until another Skullkin nervously fumbling managed to put the jaw back in its place, that the silence was broken.
      </br>
      <i>"Please exalted SkullKing of the Underworld. I am just a messenger. Bu… bu… bu… but it would seem that the Mayor knows there is some fishy going on. Maybe he has figured out the true purpose of the structures. I think he…"</i>
    </br>
    Another blue blast sent the skull flying across the plateau. Baby bone spiders fled into cracks in the ground, as it settled dangerously close to the edge, a steep drop with red hot lava bubbling below. The Skullkin would have swallowed hard had it still had a throat.
  </br>
  <i>"Have I asked you to THINK?!? How can I rule Ninjago if there isn't enough Edo power to liberate me from this wretched place?!?"</i> Clouse fumed, then regained his composure. His piercing eyes scanned the legion of Skullkin which stood paralyzed by fear before him. Had he revealed too much? No! These warriors had long ago given up their ability to question authority. Clouse had spent some of his younger years studying the great battles of the past. Samukai had been a mighty warlord early in his career, but he had quickly lost his way in his greedy conquest for riches, land and power. Yet there were no records of desertions or mutinies despite all the atrocities he and his merciless armies caused. Clouse respected that. A great leader should inspire blind loyalty and fear in his followers. And have the resolve to do ANYTHING to carry the ambition forward. He had always wondered what Samukai has done to bring this strange fate to himself and his men. The history books mentioned how the flesh was ripped from their bones and how their armor and weapons dropped to the ground as their skeletons ceased to exist in Ninjago. But even his attempts… A KING'S ORDERS TO HIS SUBJECTS had failed to get any of the skulkin to decipher this riddle for him, so deep ran their shame and regret. Clouse has sat back to his throne and waved his hand dismissively. <i>"Put him back together and send him back to Ninjago. And bring this to the warden!"</i> He scribbled some fast instructions on a crumbling piece of parchment, and called over the newly rebuilt Skulkin, who nervously approached his King with new found respect. His respect was no longer based on the promise of becoming something more. But of fear.

        <b><i>I rip the blindfold from my eyes.</i></b> I am wide awake and the rift in my head burns painfully on my face. As my eyes adjust to the green light reflected on the ceiling, I summarize the new information from thhe dream. How much of it is to be trusted, and how much has been added by my own imagination? No one in Ninjago seems to know amuch about the Departed Realm, yet my dream suggests that the Departed have no desire to leave it. Trurh or wishful thinking? Not sure. Still I take some comfort in that.
        </br>
        As I step out into the sunlight, the sounuds of birds chirping greet me. No sounds of hammering. I wonder what the mayor has argued to the board of commerce, but it has clearly worked. Jerahn is waiting for me outside with a most concerned look on his face.
        </br>
        <i>"My scar has disappeared again! It just disappeared!"</i> he blurts out at me as he brushes his hair away from the forehead.
        </br>
        <i>"Yes?"</i> I reply. Of course this is strange and last we spoke of it, we were interrupted by Seliel, so I don't have the full picture.
        </br>
        <i>"Normally they fade away slowly. But this time it just disappeared! I was talking with Alyce and all of a sudden…"</i>
        </br>
        I cut him off. <i>"Who's Alyce?"</i>
        </br>
        <i>"Alyce she's… oh right! I haven't told you. Alyce is one of the others… Yang's students, you know. I was talking to her. She was out tracking the people from her village that had gone missing and…"</i>
        </br>
        I look around. The street is empty. <i>"Where is she?"</i>
        </br>
        Jerahn takes a deep breath as he realizes he's getting ahead of himself.
        </br>
        <i>"It's how we keep in touch. The scars. They come and go, but when they're the we can communicate… talk. Like a voice in our heads. Lately I haven't been able to communicate with the others, but now I can't reach Alyce either. We were "talking". She said she had come across something. A camp or something. She was sneaking in to investigate. She hushed me. But then all of a sudden our connection was lost. I could feel her confusion and fear, but then I felt a sting and then nothing. When I checked my scar was gone. WE GOTTA HELP HER! SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO HER!"</i>
        </br>
        Jerahn is wide eyed and panicky. When I ask him if he has any idea where she is, he drops to his knees and shakes his head sobbing.
        </br>
        I know how it feels to be this lost. I have been… several times.
