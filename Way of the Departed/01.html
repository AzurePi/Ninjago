          alt="Way of the Departed is written in jagged letters. Beneath it, Cole stands wearing his black gi, his face obscured by the hoodie. The green glow of his scar is evident. A green, ghostly Master Wu floats besides him and rests his hand on Cole's shoulder. Wu's legs fade into fog before reaching the ground."

        <b><i>It is cold and I am freezing.</i></b>
        <br />
        I shouldn't be, because I am not alive.
        <br />
        I am in an ice labyrinth. It feels like I have been here before, and it
        feels like I shouldn't be here.
        <br />
        My friends are with me. They are looking at their reflections in the
        walls of ice and discuss what they mean. In their reflections they look
        different. Older and wiser. They wear the robes of sensei. Jay seems
        ecstatic that his reflection has an eye patch. He thinks it is cool.
        Then there is a change in his mood and he seems to be hiding something.
        We haven't been the best of friends lately. I try not to think too much
        about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I walk up to the ice wall I wonder about my own reflection. I look
        alive again and it doesn't quite make sense. My hands are glowing bright
        orange, but what really catches my eye is something on my forehead. A
        small green scar. I get really close to get a good look, and realize
        that there is something moving inside it. It starts to glow. I am
        blinded by light as I stare into an abyss.
        <br />
        My friends and I have seen many strange things and places, but this one
        takes the cake. Faces float by in a constantly twisting maelstrom of
        green. They are hard to make out, but some seem familiar to me, and I
        hear a voice I have not heard in a long time. It is calling my name over
        and over.
        <br />
        It hurts deep inside, so I take a step back from the wall. But my
        reflection doesn't respond. He just stands there staring coldly back at
        me. The scar on his forehead starts to convulse. First just a bit but
        then more violently. And then his entire head splits open. It is
        unbearable to watch, but I find myself unable to look away. The headless
        body falls to the ground without a sound, but the scar remains floating
        in mid air. I try to turn away, but now I can't move. My friends are
        still chatting, but it seems like their voices are a million miles away.
        I realize this is the end. The scar keeps growing and is now as big as
        me. I just stand there, as it leaves the ice wall. It comes at me and
        consumes me. Everything goes green.
      </p>

        <b><i>This is when I wake up.</i></b
        >It always is. I must have had this dream a hundred times, but I have
        never told anyone about it. It's <i>my</i> secret and there seems to be
        a lot of those lately.

        I am in my room in our home, an old temple floating a three hundred
        yards above ground. We don't know why. It just did one day. I suspect
        Jay and Nya know something about it somehow. The have been really close
        lately, sometimes playful and clearly in love, but other times they seem
        bewildered, talk in hushed voices and they seem to be examining the
        temple grounds. I am happy for them but it's also disturbing. I know
        something about the Temple of Airjitzu as well; it is still haunted. I
        could tell the others but it would freak out Jay, so I've kept it to
        myself. Secrets.
      </p>

        Waking up tonight is different though. My room is bathed in a bright
        green light. It reminds me of how Lloyd's eyes have started changing
        after Master Wu went missing. He trains alone so intensely, and he is
        really connecting with his powers… whatever it is. He has done well
        filling in after Master Wu, but he is clearly not comfortable with it.
        <br />
        After a few seconds of trying to find the source of the green light, I
        realize the source is me. The light comes from me. From the scar on my
        forehead. And that's not the only thing which is different.
        <br />
        By the window the ghost of Master Yang floats in mid air. I get the
        feeling he has been watching me for a while. There is an expression of
        sadness on his face which I haven't seen since that night on top of the
        temple. The night he intended to curse me, but ended up saving me. I
        became mortal again and he chose to remain behind as the master of the
        house… or tried to save me as I am about to be told.
      </p>
      <p>
        After an uncomfortable silence I ask him about my glowing scar. His
        voice quivers as he speaks and the answer cuts me like a knife. "My dear
        Cole. That's not a scar… it's a rift. And it will open soon…".
