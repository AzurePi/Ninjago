An html collection of the Ninjago could-be-canon stories by show creator Tommy Andreasen.
This is a work in progress, and will eventually include both ***The Way of the Departed*** (which takes place in between **Hands of Time** and **Sons of Garmadon**) and ***The Splinter in the Blind Man's Eye*** (which takes place in between **March of the Oni** and **Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitsu**).

All of the story and art in Way of the Departed belong to Tommy Andreasen, [@TommyAndreasen](https://twitter.com/TommyAndreasen) on Twitter.

Links to the posts containing the original sotry are provided.
This project brings me no monetary gain whatsoever, and is done purely as html practice and out of love for Ninjago. No copyright infrigment intended.
