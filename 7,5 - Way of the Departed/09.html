        It recognizes him from previous encounters, and what little remains of its soul holds a grudge. But it has specific orders from the new King to only observe and report. The promise to soon become something more echoes in its mostly empty skull. The faint memory, regret and embarrassment of his cowardice from back when he was still a he is ever present. The King has promised to take that away. For all of them. Soon this torment that has lasted for so long will go away. The new King has promised. He has told them to be patient.

        <b><i>I feel like I am being watched,</i></b> but I brush it off. I need to clear my head before I face Seliel and her father. Some tea will help.
        </br>
        The young girl who pours my tea in the darkened tea room studies my scar curiously but asks no questions. I dig deep for some guidance. As I run trough Master Wu's lessons, I feel equal measures of gratitude, sorrow and encouragement. We learned so much from him, yet there was always more than he told us. Like some truth we weren't ready for.
        </br>
        When I was three years old, my mother told me that the moon was made of green cheese. That seemed like a pretty good explanation at the time, and I trusted her completely. When I was six a history teacher in school told me that the storm god Wohira created the mood. She crystallized a bolt of lightning and raised it far above Ninjago to light our way in the dark. I was dumbstruck. Why had mother lied to me? It took me a few minutes before I realized that she hadn't. She had just given me the truth that would make most sense for me at the time. The idea of a god like being would have sent my childlike mind into a spiralling loop of confusion.
        </br>
        A few days later another teacher told me that the moon was a giant cold rock thousands of miles away, suspended in an infinite void of airless darkness. Did they lie to me intentionally or were they merely offering options to make up my own mind about something which no-one has a definite answer to?
        </br>
        The tea warms me as I realize that my mind has wandered off topic. I am supposed to figure out what to tell the mayor later today. I dig for a lessom from Master Wu again. I wonder what he thinks of the moon. Did his father, the First Spinjitzu Master create it? Does he know for sure? What other truths has he been keeping from us?

        <b><i>It's embarrassing.</i></b> It's happened several times now. I am surprised none of the others have noticed it yet. It's not easy to maintain your dignity, giving out instructions when your voice suddenly betrays you. The whole situation is weird to me. Here I am, youngest of the ninja, fighting to keep my confidence and show leadership. And then my voice starts to break. I know my mother has noticed. She keeps reassuring me that I am doing a great job as Sensei, but I guess that's just what moms do; Tell you what you need to hear at the time. I guess something is working though. The others have definitely developed their Spinjitzu skills over the fast few months. Searching for Master Wu rather than fighting an enemy has presented us with some new opportunities and given us a different routine. We are less distracted by events beyond our control, and more focused at the task at hand. Even though I am really connecting with my powers, my ability to summon my elemental dragon is fading. My eyes are changing and now my voice is changing too. I am getting stronger and weaker. Puberty or something greater?
        </br>
        I check to see if the coast is clear. It's great to have Claire around, but it's also clear to me that she is more eager to explore the temple than she is to clean it. Hiring her was my idea and I don't regret that, I just need to be more careful now. I found the Book of Spinjitzu in my room shortly after Master Wu got lost in time. I was only very lightly concealed, so it is clear that he intended me to find it. When I first opened it, there were several blank pages, but as I touched the book my power connected with it, and texts appeared. Text written by Master Wu, but not with his normal delicate penmanship. This was written by a trembling hand.

        <i>Having been struck by Acronix's time punch, I am rapidly aging. I will fall in time as any warrior will and I feel my remaining time here in Ninjago is short. You will be the one to carry on the lessons of Spinjitzu. These words are meant for your eyes only. May your power guide you to the greater truth.</i>

        As I leafed through the pages more texts and even drawings appeared. I have read the whole book from cover to cover as dozen times over now. Each time there seems to be something new, or something I somehow missed. It's like the book will only reveal certain passages when you need it. I wonder what new knowledge it holds for me today.

        <b>The Elemental Masters</b> have long been the guardians of Ninjago. Millennia ago, my father bestowed their ancestors with the power of all of the elements. Is this something he told me, or something I dreamt up myself? It's blurry sometimes. Many times and for many generations have they joined together in the defence of Ninjago.
        </br>
        40 years ago, your father and myself led the alliance of the Elemental Masters. It was Ninjago's last stand against Master Chen, his dark sorcerer Clouse and the Serpentine. Chen fooled us all into playing his game of war. He cleverly used manipulation, deception, dark magic and the hypnotic powers of the snakes to turn Elemental Masters against each others. But we won! Or so we thought.
        </br>
        Shortly after our victory we faced a new enemyâ€¦ two of our own: Krux and Acronix - The Hands of Time.
        </br>
        It is only just now, aging in bed, that I have put together the full puzzle. Master Chen, when he realized his defeat was imminent, had Clouse use dark magic to motivate an idea in Krux and Acronix; That their elemental powers were superior, and that they could win the fight Chen had just lost. He let them know of a secret nest of eggs from the Great Devourer. After 40 years of preparation they put the eggs to evil use: The Vermilion. You know the rest.
