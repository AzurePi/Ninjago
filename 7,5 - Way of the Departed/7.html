He is wearing his black gi, his hood pulled down and his warhammer straped to his back. The green glow of his scar wraps around his head. He is looking at a painting that hangs crooked at a wall. From the picture, the green, ghostly image of Master Chen lunges forward. Green mist and light sprouts from his hands and the picture itself. Beneath the picture, there are broken shelves with trinkets, and a tilted vase. To the side, there is a larger vase, a sheathed sword, and a spear." width="100%" />

        <b><i>It makes sense now.</i></b> At least that nonsensical and elusive ghost sense that I've gotten used to dealing with. Here is a painting of Master Yang looking back at me. It is different from the one at the museum and the ones still hanging in our temple. This one is more crudely painted.
        </br>
        <i>"Master Yang did not just teach us Airiitzu,"</i> Jerahn says, <i>"It was a whole philosophy. A lot of pieces that needed to fit together. Patience, focus, meditation and such; Master Yang combined the lessons in various different ways. In the earlier hours on end painting him while he was in some meditative trance. In the beginning I found the whole thing stupid and vain on his part."</i>
        </br>
        Jerahn has a guilty look on his face saying that.
        </br>
        <i>"But eventually I got it. He was teaching us tolerance, focus and patience. Realizing that, the obstacle moved out of the way, and my path to Airjitzu became much easier."</i>
        </br>
        I ask him about how the painting got here. He shrugs.
        </br>
        <i>"We saw a LOT of lootings during our time as ghosts in the temple. Thieves would come at any time during the day or night. I admit we had some fun scaring them off. Even captives need some fun. But also there was a purpose to it… getting them out before the clock struck and all. We did those guys a favour! You know all too well what happens. Some thieves made it with some of those Edo period artifacts they came for though. I guess that's how the painting ended up here."</i> He laughs.
        </br>
        <i>"Someone must have thought my strokes were authentic Edo period artwork. Can you believe that?!? I think I should feel proud."</i>
        </br>
        I am transfixed on Master Yang's stern look on the painting. So that's one question answered: that's how he could reach out to this place and knew where I should go. But the answer just opens up new ones. First one that comes to mind is about Jerahn's dream. He seems almost relieved by my question. He has been holding it in for too long. When he started to tell me, it sensd a shiver down my spine.
        </br>
        <i>"It's cold. It's almost like I'm dead. I am in some Ice labyrinth. I know it's just a dream because I am with you guys. The Ninja I mean. And since I do not know you guys and I am in a place which I do not know, I figure that it's just a dream. Still it feels pretty real though. You guys are staring at the ice, so I figure that I should do that too. But I get distracted by a voice. It's a young voice filled with determination, but also conflict and pain. I don't know who he is talking to and sometimes it even seems like he is arguing with himself in two different voices. I find my way around the ice wall to check it out. It's the green ninja… but his voice sounds  different… like it comes from a different place and he looks pale. He shakes his head violently, put on his cowl and gets out his weapons. I see you on the other side of the ice. He lunges at you, slashes the ice and cleaves your head in two… I am paralyzed. Your scar hangs in mid air convulsing. It's the big green glow of light that wakes me up."</i>
        </br>
        I look at it like it can offer some explanation.
        </br>
        I look back at the painting and decide to play my cards close to the chest. This is getting complicated and I am not as smart as Zane. Jerahn and I both have secrets. We are both here because of Seliel and Nom's kindness, but we are not being honest. Can we be honest? What is going on here in Nom? The town is being mended using materials from Edo period cities. Cities whose houses are being re-purposed because they were uninhabited. People have gone missing, and now this place is being ornamented by their cities' remains. Does Seliel know about that? Does her father? He is the mayor after all! This is getting too complicated and I need time to think. As if reading my mind Jerahn continues.
        </br>
        <i>"You know how I found out about those cities? Some of the others. Other students I mean. Some returned to their villages, only to find their homes torn down and their families missing. They are out there searching for them right now. And I'm here decorating Nom with THEIR homes… how messed up is that?!?! I have been talking…"</i>
      </br>
      <i>"JERAHN!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!!"</i> Seliel's irate call echoes from below. Jerahn looks to me as if I can offer some advice. <i>"You can not avoid her for long. Go meet her and say we will all talk tonight… and tell her to bring her father too. I will have a look at this stuff and board up. Don't worry about it."</i> Jerahn gives me a grateful nod and exits.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am alone again, but I know I won't be for long. Staring into the eyes of the painting brings me to a dreamlike trance that I have experience only once before. Master Yang starts to move and it's time to get some answers.
        </br>
        It is odd to see him animate in the picture. It seems like he can’t quite adjust to Jerahn’s brush strokes, and the situation becomes somewhat awkward. He finally gets comfortable or just ignores it. Then he focuses his attention on me.
        </br>
        <i>"Cole my boy… I am… glad that you have found this painting and that we have this opportunity to talk. Have you found anyone… how are your dreams?"</i> He looks worried at the rift on my head. I quickly fill him in. As I talk about Jerahn his spirit seems uplifted, but as I get to the Edo era was towns he looks shocked. I finish. He doesn't speak for a while, but when he does, it is with great concern and seriousness.
        </br>
        <i>"The Edo period was a time known for great magic. The Edo magic was practiced by many sorcerers in the southern parts of Ninjago. Most used it for good, but the magic was not safe. It was unpredictable and disruptive. Easy to use but not hard to get wrong. I don't know much about since it was mostly lost. I did some studying on the subject when first moved into the temple, but not many texts exist. I did find out that Edo is ancient ninjargan for earth. Edo magic drew upon the power of the earth. The Edo Sorcerers needed to draw up and focus the power. That is the origin of the Edo era villages. Their towers and spires, just like the Temple of Airjitzu, were designed to channel and concentrate the power of the earth so the sorcerers had easy access to it and could draw upon it when they needed to. But as I said; Edo magic often produced unpredictable results. It wiped itself and its users out. But now it seems that Nom is bringing all of these Edo relics here. An enormous amount of Edo power will build up. Who can be behind this?"</i> Master Yang silences.
        </br>
        Sorcerer? I know only one sorcerer. The last time I saw him I was still a ghost and so was he. On the Dark Island.
