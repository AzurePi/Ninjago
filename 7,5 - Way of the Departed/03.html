        <b><i>It is night and I am tired.</i></b> Soon I will need to sleep.
        Surrendering myself to the dream again scares me. The bonfire in front
        of me crackles. It should warm me but I feel cold like in the dream. For
        the hundredth time I question why I went alone. “Ninja never leave a
        ninja behind. Work as a team. Trust your friends.” All those lessons
        Master Wu taught us. Why am I ignoring them? I guess there are some
        things that you just need to do on your own. Master Wu went alone to
        confront Acronix at the burned down monastery. Look what that got him:
        rapidly aging and ultimately trapped in time. I feel like I have failed
        him. Why am I here on a quest of my own when Lloyd swore we would not
        rest until we found him again? We have done a lot of searching, but this
        is not like finding a lost pair of gloves. Master Wu was lost in time,
        so this is not just a question of where but also when. It could be
        impossible. Maybe he is not even here yet or has been and no longer is.
        We all know it. No one has said it out loud, though I have felt Jay
        bursting to do so several times. Restraint from Jay… imagine that! I
        guess we are growing older. He is my search partner. Lloyd split us up
        in the beginning to widen the search. Two in each search party. Jay and
        I, Kai and Zane, Nya and Lloyd.
      </br>
      Jay is good company, if you can endure the constant steam of words coming at you. He keeps jabbering on about the secret identity of Samurai X claiming that he's got it all figured out. He must have guessed on everyone in Ninjago by now. Even someone called Ekosan, though he quickly disregarded that theory and then flat out denied having ever said it. One day he almost assaulted the helpless mail man who was just dropping on yet another flyer from Patty Keys. <i>"Admit it! Reveal your secret!"</i>, he shouted at him. The poor guy started stuttering something about the obscure practices on how it is decided who gets their portrait on a stamp and who doesn't. In a good/bad cop situation, Jay would definitely be the bad cop. Lloyd saved the mail man that day and apologized. We didn't see him for six weeks after that.
    </br>
    First we hit the Library at Domu. Jay had all these wild theories about time travel, and theorized that if Master Wu had fallen into the past, he would have left a message or a book for us to find there. Fourteen days of intense reading later, we abandoned the book idea. He could have left a message in any way… more likely a message on something more durable than paper. Carving on rocks? We then started searching places that held special meaning to him: the monastery where he lived with his brother. The Caves of Despair where Morro had perished. Zane and Kai even hired Ronin to take them to the First Spinjtzu Master's Tomb. But leaving no rock unturned is a better saying than something lived out in real life. Just like "We shall not rest until…".
  </br>
  That's why we returned to the Temple once in a while: to rest. But we were all restless. So rest turned to training instead. We found new techniques and opportunities within Spinjitzu. Ray and Maya couldn't be very helpful either. They had created the Time Blades and we still had one of them. But just the one and no plan. Also Lloyd insisted that it was too dangerous to keep around, so Kai and Nya returned it to the Boiling Sea. It will be safe there… only a master of water and fire together can go there.
</br>
After reuniting with Kai and Nya, Ray and Maya went on a tour of Ninjago. They probably still are catching up. Kai and Nya went on for so many years not knowing what happened to them. That must have been hard. And now they have to go through the whole thing again but with Master Wu. I am tired of losing people in my life! I hope Ray and Maya are having fun and I hope that Kai and Nya are sti…

       <b><i>It is cold and I am freezing.</i></b>  I shouldn't be, because I am not alive. I am in an ice labyrinth. It feels like I…
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><i>I wake with a jerk.</i></b> Where am I? I stare into a bonfire… oh yes… of course, I must have nodded off for a second. Man, that dream is there immediately. It's like a predator stalking me and just waiting for me to let my guard down. I drink some tea and eat a bite of Mrs. Walker's crumb cake that I brought along with me. It doesn't taste very good tonight though. I'm sure that it is more my state of mind's than the cake's fault, but it tastes like ash… I still wash it down with the tea. Eating cake is like muscle memory to me. It's just something I do to occupy my hands and mouth some times. I love cake but I think it would be healthy for me to cut back. In several ways.
      </br>
      I think about what Master Yang told me. He has told me not to call him master, but it still slips once in a while.
    </br>
    Though he is bound to the temple, he can still reach out into the outside world through former possessions of his. Like that painting on the wall in the museum. He was careful not to get my hopes up too much, but he suggested that I would start my search for answers at a village called Nom. I recognize the name, but I can't quite put my finger on it. We were together when he reached out. It took all of his concentration. It was extra hard because of the distance he told me afterwards. I swear could almost see him sweating. A ghost sweating… that's a contradiction in itself. When I was a ghost I never sweated. I wonder if sweat would have stung. Ghost logic… who can really tell? When he finished, he was completely exhausted. He could hardly talk, but said that he had felt a presence in Nom who might be able to shed some light on my situation. I should be able to get there by tomorrow night if I walk all day.
  </br>
  But before that, there is one big obstacle in my way, and it's time I close my eyes to face it.
</br>
I take one last sip of tea, throw another log on the fire and scowl myself for not bringing a blanket. I guess planning ahead is not my strong suit. Tonight will be a cold one.
</br>
I close my eyes and try to think happy thoughts.
</br>
I am 5 years old. I see my father and my mother dancing in the moonlight on the terrace in front of our old house. I have been tucked in, but I've snuck out to watch them. I do that often. My dad is so elegant. When grow up I want to a be a dancer just like him. Why would I want to be anything else in world which so perfect?
