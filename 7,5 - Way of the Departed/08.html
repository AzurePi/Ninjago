        <b><i>I need to be patient.</i></b> It has become my cursed mantra during my residency here. I have been patient all of my life so why should death be any different for me? I have spent most of my life as a follower. In death I have attempted to come into my own. I knew what remained of me had limited time in Ninjago so I had to seek new battlegrounds. My Realm of Shadows endeavor was not exactly a success. The Ninja managed to bring the Dragon of Light before me. Later I failed to acquire the Teapot of Tyrahn in time and left for the Dark Island. But even there the Ninja thwarted my plans… or rather my old rival's brother thwarted me with their father's golden hulk of an atrocity. I hate light… it seems to be my bane. Even Garmadon had embraced the light and become a goody-two-shoes when he cheated me into the Cursed Realm. I should have know better. Even when he was younger he was a cheat. Using Spinjutzu to rob me of my rightful title of Lord. Dishonorable!
        </br>
        I escaped and now I am here. Being patient… King of my own Realm… Sitting on a throne made from the bones of dead men. King of the Underworld.
        </br>
        This place was ripe for a take over. These plain Skullkin are sheep with no direction. They are broken warriors disgraced in battle without redemption or honour. They are creatures with no aspiration and direction and yearn to be governed and be shown a way. And do I have plans of them!
        </br>
        But for now I must remain patient. The plan is nearing its conclusion: the Elemental Master in my employ has played its part for now. It will be a matter of time before my helpless pawn in Nom finishes his misguided vanity project. The boy with the rift has been lured into place, and soon when enough Edo power has built up, I will rip open that rift and put my prisoners and my undead warriors to good use Patience…

        <b><i>"Clouse?"</i></b> Yang ponders. I have just told him everything about our previous encounters with the sorcerer.
        </br>
        <i>"I know about Chen. I did invite him back on the Day of the Departed."</i> He look ashamed saying that. <i>"But I never knew he had an associate who was a sorcerer. And an Edo Sorcerer at that. I guess some of the more stable incantations were documented in that book of his. You were wise to burn it."</i>
        </br>
        He is a ghost now, but he can still do magic."</i> I tell him. <i>"On the Dark Island he used dark matter to strengthen his magic. But Master Wu stopped him. We saw him be pulled through some vortex and we have no idea what happened to him. Do you really think this can have something to do with him?"</i> I ask though I kind of know what the reply will be.
        </br>
        <i>"We must assume the worst. I doubt you will find him in this realm though… at least yet. Ghosts can only sustain themselves for so long in Ninjago without being attached to a physical vessel, but you know this is still an Edo Sorcerer out there somewhere is indeed troubling. I must ponder this."</i> It looks like he is about to withdraw from the painting, but I stop him. I need to know about Jerahn's dream.
        </br>
        <i>"It is not clear yet."</i> He shakes his head. <i>"But there are three things you, Jerahn and Morro have in common. You have been touched by death, and each of you in your own way have been cursed. You have been freed from theirs. Maybe you should take some hope and consolation in that”</i> I remind him that Morro had to die to be completely free himself of his. Sensei Yang looks as troubled as he fades.
      </p>
      <p>
        I board up the secret room as I think hard about what Yang just told me, and how much of this I need to share with Seliel and her dad. I am in two minds about how much I can trust them. My mind is racing with connections. Me, Jerahn, Morro… even Clouse? We have all been ghosts. And then there is the whole Edo, earth, rift, buildings, and me connection. Is the rift on my forehead opening because I, Master of Earth, have been around buildings which draw on the Edo power? Here I am in a new Edo hotspot of Ninjago! Maybe I should just get far away from here and the Temple of Airjitzu. That, all of a sudden, seems like a very compelling solution to try out. But then I think of Jerahn, the students, their neighbors and families who may need help. Ninja never leaves a ninja behind… I remember that much, Master!
        </br>
        I make my way down the building discreetly. As I walk though the town I hear a very familiar voice from a nearby window. My father and his Royal Blacksmiths are singing "Revenge will be Mine" from a radio while an old woman cleaning dishes hums along. It became quite a hit after the Stone Warriors attacked on the Day of the Departed. Gayle Gossip and her news crew were broadcasting from the concert, and because of the exposure and reruns the event got in the days after, my dad and his band decided to re-release the song. It was never a big hit, but now it's really taken off. It would be nice to see him happy again. Like real happiness. Money is not the answer, but maybe if they make a nice profit off it, he may be able to really relax a bit and find some new creative spark. I hope so. It's really what drives him. I think of Jay and how cheerful he seems. He was born in a junk yard and has poor parents… so I guess money and happines aren't really connected. Lately he has been trying to convince me that with Lightning Powers also come Lightning Foresight. <i>"Today a letter will arrive! A letter that will grant a great fortune! The Lightning Foresight has sparked the knowledge in my mind!"</i> he has dramatically proclaimed a number of times.Aand then he has almost overpowered the mail-man to get the mail yelling <i>"WHY ARE YOU HOLDING OUT ON ME!!! HAND IT OVER ALREADY!!!"</i>… Poor mail-man.
        </br>
        But back to the issue a hand: What do I tell Seliel and her father?!?! I guess I have a few hours to work it out. I take in the Edo era buildings. They seem like a threat to me now. Like an enemy waiting to strike. The rift on my head hurts and I hear the voice from the dream call my name again. I convince myself that I just imagined it, but it seems all too real. I recognize the voice, but it's not the tender voice from my childhood anymore. It's filled with sorrow and desperation… The kind of tone you speak to one who is beyond your reach.

        <b><i>As Cole walks down the street,</i></b> a pair of eyes watch him. Or rather an empty pair of eye-sockets on a creature that has been promised by its new King soon to be whole again…
